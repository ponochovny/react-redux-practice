# React Redux Practice

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and the [Demo is here](https://ponochovny.github.io/react-redux-practice/).  
As I was being interviewing, I was struggling of answering some simple react redux questions :face_exhaling:. So I just decided to build a simple app using react redux and get used to it and build more complex redux logic also using middlewares :monocle_face: :tada:.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
